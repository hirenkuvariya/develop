            <p>Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available goods or services presented by one or more retailers with the potential intent to purchase a suitable selection of them. A typology of shopper types has been developed by scholars which identifies one group of shoppers as recreational shoppers,[1] that is, those who enjoy shopping and view it as a leisure activity.[2]
    
                Online shopping has become a major disruptor in the retail industry[3] as consumers can now search for product information and place product orders across different regions. Online retailers deliver their products directly to the consumers' home, offices, or wherever they want. The B2C (business to consumer) process has made it easy for consumers to select any product online from a retailer's website and to have it delivered relatively quickly. Using online shopping methods, consumers do not need to consume energy by physically visiting physical stores. This way they save time and the cost of traveling. A retailer or a shop is a business that presents a selection of goods and offers to trade or sell them to customers for money or other goods.
                
                Shoppers' shopping experiences may vary. They are based on a variety of factors including how the customer is treated, convenience, the type of goods being purchased, and mood.[4]

        <p>The modern phenomenon of shopping for pleasure is closely linked to the emergence of a 
            middle class in the 17th and 18th-century Europe. As standards of living improved in the 17th 
            century, consumers from a broad range of social backgrounds began to purchase goods that were in 
            excess of basic necessities. An emergent middle class or bourgeosie stimulated demand for luxury 
            goods and began to purchase a wider range of luxury goods and imported goods, including: 
            Indian cotton and calico; silk, tea and porcelain from China, spices from India and South-East 
            Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World.[17] The act of shopping came to be seen 
            as a pleasurable pass-time or form of entertainment.[2]
            By the 17th-century, produce markets gradually gave way to shops and shopping centres; 
            which changed the consumer's shopping experience.[18] The New Exchange, opened in 1609 by Robert Cecil in the 
            Strand was one such example of a planned shopping centre. Shops started to become important as places for 
            Londoners to meet and socialise and became popular destinations alongside the theatre. Restoration London 
            also saw the growth of luxury buildings as advertisements for social position with speculative architects 
            like Nicholas Barbon and Lionel Cranfield.
